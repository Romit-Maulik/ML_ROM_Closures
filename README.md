# ML_ROM_Closures
Using sequential learning techniques for closing reduced-order models

## Runs
These are results using the hand-tuned hyperparameters

## HPS
These are results using deephyper for hyperparameter optimization

## Note
For visualizing results from LSTM deployments use `python Burgers_POD_ROM.py` and for NODE deployments use `python NODE_Burgers.py`. Change `deployment_mode = 'test'` to `deployment_mode = 'train'` within these files to retrain the framework. This repo will have further documentation added to it slowly - in the meanwhile please contact rmaulik@anl.gov for any questions.
